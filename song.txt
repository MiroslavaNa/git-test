Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hopin’ I don't repeat history

Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday

Never need no, no one else, babe
’Cause I'll be

Switchin' the positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
,la

I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumpin' through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin’ I wouldn’t do
That I won't do, switchin’ for you

bla bla
